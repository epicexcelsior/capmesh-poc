# FieldProof verification record

Current continuation: October 5, 2026, Europe/Berlin. Public paid evidence dates to October 1 and October 5.
The local MVP completes a public Devnet purchase, a real ESP32 observation, and both human-controlled contact states.
This record does not claim production security, safety certification, or standards compliance.

## October 5 BOOT application restore

Starting source: clean, pushed `c3f8cd8b936e9c980dab39cb4b4a61f37679a8c6` on `main`.
The operator confirmed the board is clear and connected. The added leads are removed.
The saved factory application matched its original SHA256 and 2,031,616-byte length before restoration.
esptool wrote only the application at `0x10000`, verified its hash, and reset the board.
The NVS key storage and partition table were not written.

`python3 scripts/demo.py board --expect open` passed one actual GPIO9 BLE observation.
The result was device-signed OPEN, DISPATCH, age four seconds, and five matching samples.
The bounded runner completed in 12.436 seconds and verified the existing pinned signing key.
The fresh signed answer confirms the restored input descriptor and signing-key continuity.
The controlled visible browser completed two separate real GPIO9 requests after human actions.
Held BOOT returned signed CLOSED/WAIT at age four seconds, with five matching samples.
Released BOOT returned signed OPEN/DISPATCH at age four seconds, with five matching samples.
The same OPEN answer expired to WAIT at eleven seconds, under the actual clock.
Both requests used the existing pinned device key and simulated settlement. No funds moved.

A separate visible Chromium window opens the focused physical page for the founder.
Its recording contains only the controlled FieldProof page. It does not capture the microphone, camera, or unrelated applications.
The browser issued each request only after the corresponding operator confirmation. Its gateway uses simulated settlement and real hardware.
The completed silent capture remains local. A new non-recording window is ready for the founder's manual rehearsal.
Its twenty-second OPEN-to-expired excerpt starts at source time 216 seconds and preserves original speed and clock behavior.
The footer labels real ESP32 input and simulated payment. H.264 decode and fresh/expired frame inspection passed.
Excerpt SHA256: `3d66a24f2fe9a7780db48971fa78be5f658827f62e9dae24b1aa97f774226c38`.
The saved actual Devnet payment remains separate evidence. No new funds moved during restoration or the released-input check.

## October 5 founder recording consolidation

Starting source: clean, pushed `54d1c05aa0a7700c5ae475247f2d08dd0dce36b3` on `main`.
The canonical recording script now contains four scenes and 197 suggested spoken words.
The local reader matches all four spoken blocks. Recording setup and technical reference remain folded below the script.
The local start page links the live input, actual payment excerpt, saved inspector, and next pilot.

The actual paid capture contains a long initial wait and only a few seconds of fresh acceptance.
A ten-second excerpt starts at source time 22.8 seconds. It preserves original playback speed and receipt times.
An 80-pixel footer labels it as the recorded actual October 5 Devnet purchase.
The original 1280 × 900 frame remains visible without cropping. The full capture remains available.
The excerpt is supporting footage. Founder narration and the live physical scene remain unrecorded.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Gateway suite | `npm --prefix gateway test`: 51 passed, zero failed, 783.474225 milliseconds. |
| Export and launcher suite | `uv run --project host pytest -q tests/test_judge_export.py tests/test_demo_launcher.py`: 15 passed in 0.23 seconds. |
| Full and focused simulator | Both browser runs passed configured terms, OPEN/DISPATCH, current-time expiry to WAIT, and mobile width. Focused view fits 1280 × 900 and 1920 × 1080. No funds or hardware. |
| Quote presentation regression | A new quote reset the decision text to WAIT but retained the preceding DISPATCH color. The reproduced class was `decision`. Resetting it to `decision wait` fixed the mismatch. Both browser runs cover this transition. |
| Local materials | Four canonical spoken blocks, fourteen local links, frame navigation, desktop/mobile width, and no page errors passed. The first helper read a fold's state before the hash event completed. Waiting for the visible state corrected the helper. |
| Current actual payment query | One read-only `getTransaction` request verified the unchanged October 5 transfer at slot 507676124. VALID signature, EXPIRED age, WAIT, tamper rejection, and original recovery passed. No RPC fixture or clock override. |
| Excerpt | H.264, 1280 × 980, 25 fps, ten seconds, no audio. Complete decode and visual frame inspection passed. SHA256: `a02a8459dbb92479863666ede08b27d71c158bc240041bfb314459ecc18e3a2f`. |
| Source and visual review | Changed JavaScript syntax and whitespace checks passed. The focused input, paid inspector, start page, and labeled excerpt were inspected. Primary review checked the source diff and truthful mode labels. No independent review ran. |

The attached application remains GPIO20. The operator must remove added leads and confirm the bare board before restoration.
No button application restore, new hardware reading, payment, phone-camera recording, or microphone test occurred in this change.
OBS and phone instructions remain an owner procedure. They do not establish a successful founder recording.
Public hosting, eligibility confirmation, registration, and human submission remain incomplete.

## October 5 GPIO20 package-contact preparation

Starting source: clean, pushed `aee9e754ccdf3aa10add0e80268d54d66f526d85` on `main`.
The operator reports ESP32-C6 Super Mini, printed `20` and `GND` labels, and a disconnected external LED.
The ROM reports ESP32-C6FH4 revision 0.2. GPIO20 has no other firmware assignment.
The official chip GPIO table lists USB on GPIO12/13 and strapping on GPIO4/5/8/9/15.
[Espressif GPIO restrictions](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/stable/esp32c6/api-reference/peripherals/gpio.html).
The board manufacturer, revision, and physical foil circuit remain unverified.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Actual button backup | Read only the factory application region at `0x10000`, length `0x1F0000`. The local backup contains 2,031,616 bytes. SHA256: `2a01f68a7e873e88390e6775c4cf6c974ef0562491aa1164ef4abf8dcada39ee`. NVS was excluded. |
| GPIO20 application flash | Wrote 1,274,320 application bytes at `0x10000`. esptool verified the written hash and reset the board. The partition table and NVS were preserved. The current input is GPIO20 with its internal pull-up. |
| Application policy | The buyer explicitly selects package pickup and GPIO20. Authenticated fresh closed contact permits DISPATCH. Open contact keeps WAIT. The default gate policy remains unchanged. Incompatible policy fails before HTTP or payment. |
| Gateway suite | `npm --prefix gateway test`: 51 passed, zero failed, 726.702998 milliseconds. New cases cover both package states, the ten/eleven-second boundary, tampering, wrong challenge, wrong key, wrong sensor, and the public output route. |
| Browser fixtures | Package, original receipt, and buyer-run scripts passed. Package fixtures cover no archive substitution, ABSENT, PRESENT, required new payment check, tampering, expiry, GPIO9 rejection, desktop fit, and mobile width. They use generated signing keys, a fixed clock, and RPC fixtures. They establish no physical or chain result. |
| Export and launcher suite | `uv run --project host pytest -q tests/test_judge_export.py tests/test_demo_launcher.py`: 15 passed in 0.17 seconds. |
| Primary review | The public-output selector initially omitted the package contact contract. Retaining it restored browser revalidation. A gateway regression checks the sanitized output again. The package view also guards the live-monitor link omitted from static exports. |
| Runtime preparation | A separate real-Devnet gateway on port 4025 reports GPIO20 and uses its own local purchase ledger. It now waits for a new PRESENT buyer output. |

The first physical open check returned GPIO20 `closed: false`, five matching samples, authenticated PACKAGE_ABSENT, and WAIT.
It verified signing-key continuity against the existing public pin.
One new 0.001 Devnet USDC purchase returned authenticated ABSENT and WAIT at age four seconds.
The browser verified its actual transfer at slot 507801924 and its fresh receipt at age six seconds.
Expiry and tampering kept WAIT. This check used the actual clock and RPC.
Purchase ID: `6416e1a74caf4906`.
[Actual ABSENT payment](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/3vJfYMKSveVA6UXSWeCjmjaev3eAYsdP14TLzqEAEYGdjRCkPEbbUStwWUe2Fr5ZFbS2nwGrbTavaoTDBA4nM4Lz?cluster=devnet).

When the operator reported touching foil, a second unpaid reading still returned authenticated ABSENT with five matching samples.
The next direct bare-lead contact check returned authenticated PRESENT, DISPATCH, and five matching samples at age four seconds.
This isolates the initial failure to foil contact. The board and original leads respond to electrical closure.
The operator then described moving a breadboard connection. The connection location remains unclear, so further hardware reads and spending remain paused.
The second payment remains unstarted. No paid PRESENT receipt or complete paid two-state package flow exists yet.
The actual GPIO9 backup provides the button fallback through an application restore. BOOT does not control the current GPIO20 input.
The unchanged signed wire labels remain `gate.closed` and `demo-gate`. Package meaning comes from the explicit local buyer policy.
The README and recording narrative still describe the verified gate demo. They will change only after the new physical flow passes.
No peaq write, public hosting, outreach, registration, or submission occurred.

## October 5 starter narration and simpler recording views

Starting source: clean `c14d505013a5a574a30381c239c385d98f99f7f3` on `main`.
The starter script owns suggested spoken words, six timed scenes, screen actions, and three optional supporting shots.
The local reader uses the canonical Markdown's six spoken blocks. The script contains 255 suggested spoken words.
Three simpler recording frames show the buyer problem, purchase order, and next pilot.
The focused inspector displays payment, signature, age, and decision. All acceptance checks continue to run.
The full page retains challenge checks, sample checks, and additional attack controls.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Browser inspector | Gateway and prefixed static export passed receipt authentication, expiry, attack controls, focused/full view, desktop fit, input archives, damaged archives, RPC fixtures, HTTP 429 recovery, and mobile width. |
| Hidden-check rejection | A historical-clock fixture retained a valid signature and fresh answer while its challenge failed. Focused view hid that row but kept WAIT and its challenge-failure explanation. This fixture establishes no current physical evidence. |
| Buyer-output fixtures | No archive substitution, required chain query, continuous expiry, output replacement, wallet rejection, asynchronous source races, viewport fit, and no-side-effect checks passed. |
| Actual laptop query | The simpler view queried the unchanged October 5 transfer at slot 507676124. It displayed VALID, VERIFIED TRANSFER, the original expired age, and WAIT. Tampering was rejected. No clock or RPC fixture occurred in this check. |
| Recording frames and reader | All three frames fit 1280 × 900 with footer bottom 813.25 pixels. Keyboard navigation, deep links, 390-pixel width, and sixteen local start links passed. The reader's six spoken blocks matched the Markdown exactly. Both reader widths and no page errors passed. |
| Gateway and export suites | `npm --prefix gateway test`: 47 passed, zero failed, 883.897807 milliseconds. `uv run --project host pytest -q tests/test_judge_export.py tests/test_demo_launcher.py`: 15 passed in 0.29 seconds. |
| Package and source checks | Thirteen manifest entries and fourteen ZIP members matched every digest and byte. Sixty-eight local documentation references resolved. Changed JavaScript syntax and `git diff --check` passed. |
| Visual review | Problem frame, purchase frame, simplified actual paid inspector, pilot frame, and local reader were inspected. Primary review checked the complete change, hidden checks, source handling, and truthful footage labels. No independent review ran. |

Current inspector ZIP SHA256: `2a6646db6e957f332ebcc9c19b74b1eae226521374dcf107fbee3d150f4b84e6`.
The existing actual paid capture remains unchanged. The script keeps BOOT as the demonstrated contact until an external fixture passes.
No payment, hardware observation, firmware flash, peaq write, public hosting, outreach, registration, or submission occurred.

An isolated GPIO20 candidate compiled with the existing ESP-IDF 6.1 toolchain and input pull-up configuration.
Initial activation failed because the generic exporter searched outside the managed installation for its Python environment and constraints.
The installed managed activation script restored the paths. Python dependency verification passed before the build. No dependency safeguard was bypassed.
The founder reports an ESP32-C6 Super Mini with printed `20` and `GND` labels. The external LED is disconnected.
GPIO20 has no other firmware assignment. This build was not flashed and establishes no external-contact or package-presence result.
Two secure foil leads, live open/closed checks, the package-specific decision rule, and end-to-end verification remain pending.

## October 5 submission graphics and upload checklist

Starting source: clean `a189233d4faa1c4034a9ee3438a4a3f5427955d9` on `main`.
This continuation adds a video cover, a square project graphic, and one materials section in the existing submission checklist.
The local start page groups the PNG downloads with the existing inspector package. The cover is a policy illustration.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Graphic rendering | Chromium rendered the self-contained SVG sources through two local GET requests. PNG dimensions are 1280 × 720 and 1024 × 1024. Text bounds remained inside both canvases. No page error or external request occurred. |
| Initial local checks | The render helper resolved its repository root one directory too high. Correcting the root restored rendering. Its misplaced generated PNG and empty directories were removed. The page helper then assumed a same-fragment navigation returned an HTTP response. Loading once before both viewport checks corrected that assertion. Neither defect changed product code. |
| Download page | At 1280 and 390 pixels, the start page loaded all three images without horizontal overflow. All eleven distinct local link paths returned HTTP 200. Both PNG and SVG download copies matched the repository assets byte for byte. |
| Visual review | Both full-size graphics, the 320-pixel video thumbnail, the 64-pixel project mark, and the mobile download section were inspected. The main headline and WAIT remain readable at thumbnail size. |
| Asset and source checks | SVG sources contain no scripts, external images, or links. PNGs contain no text or EXIF metadata. Twenty local submission references resolved. Helper syntax and `git diff --check` passed. |
| Scope review | Primary review checked the complete text and graphic changes, truthful illustration labels, explicit paths, and publication boundaries. No independent review ran. No runtime code changed, so gateway, host, firmware, and payment suites were not repeated. |

PNG SHA256 values: cover `e1168e1e403c2393ff98147480bfca05129dbbc46d56df03ce00118a8f16d7e6`, project graphic `e5dee407b2cee4921c79b1211552daf65ed1de91291f57af014045f90a2c0fd7`.
The local render and download-check helpers preserve commands and reports. The inspector ZIP remains byte-for-byte unchanged.
No payment, hardware request, firmware change, peaq write, hosting deployment, outreach, registration, or submission occurred.
Founder narration, public links, eligibility confirmation, project registration, and human submission remain incomplete.

## October 5 evidence-age display and recording route

Starting source: clean `4c3948ea0aeb7ebfd3cd1b1f6d1d27f8ae2afafa` on `main`.
This continuation adds an evidence-age display, a focused payment status, one expiry illustration, and three local recording frames.
It consolidates the tagline, README opening, recording cues, alternatives, and incomplete human-submission fields.
The acceptance policy, device receipt, payment rail, and hardware configuration remain unchanged.
No new payment, measurement, wallet, firmware flash, GPIO output, peaq write, public hosting, or human submission occurred.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Initial inspector layout | The added age and payment displays pushed controls below the 900-pixel viewport. Both existing fit assertions failed. |
| Inspector layout correction | Measured workspace bottom: 929.64 pixels. Shorter duplicate text and compact presentation spacing restored fit. Desktop and mobile checks passed. |
| Buyer-monitor fixtures | The same signed answer remained accepted at age ten seconds and expired at eleven seconds. Payment stayed VERIFIED TRANSFER and signature stayed VALID. Missing/replaced sources cleared age and payment status. Race, wallet rejection, and no-side-effect checks passed. |
| Receipt inspector | Gateway and final prefixed static package passed original signature, expiry, three attacks, focus modes, input archives, damaged archives, RPC fixtures, HTTP 429 recovery, and mobile width. |
| Actual laptop query | The updated inspector queried the actual October 5 transfer at slot 507676124. It showed VALID, VERIFIED TRANSFER, the original expired age, and WAIT. No clock or RPC fixture occurred. |
| Actual Seeker recovery | The first navigation failed with connection refused. The laptop returned HTTP 200 and `adb reverse --list` was empty. Restoring USB reverse forwarding restored the page. The runbook now includes this recovery. |
| Actual Seeker check | Chrome verified the same actual transfer, original age, expired WAIT, and tamper rejection. The original was restored. No horizontal overflow, page error, payment, or hardware request occurred. Temporary DevTools forwarding was removed. |
| Gateway suite | `npm --prefix gateway test`: 47 passed, zero failed, 761.438 milliseconds. |
| Focused Python suite | `uv run --project host pytest -q tests/test_judge_export.py tests/test_demo_launcher.py`: 15 passed in 0.23 seconds. Host and firmware code did not change. The prior full Python result remains 204 passed and ten hardware skips. |
| Launcher and simulator | `python3 scripts/demo.py check` passed all three prerequisite checks. `python3 scripts/demo.py sim` started the declared no-funds server. The browser purchase check passed configured terms, DISPATCH, real-time expiry, mobile width, and no page errors. No hardware occurred. |
| Founder guide | Six steps, three modes, eight software outcomes, deep references, unique anchors, desktop/mobile width, and no page errors passed. |
| Recording frames | Initial frames exceeded the recording viewport. Measured image heights and spacing explained the overflow. The final three frame bottoms were 836.09, 868.05, and 893.38 pixels. All fit 1280 × 900. Keyboard navigation, deep links, and 390-pixel width passed. |
| Local start page | Three owner tasks, twelve local links, mobile width, and no page errors passed. It points to one current export and recording route. |
| Export integrity | Thirteen manifest entries and fourteen ZIP members matched every digest and archived byte. Existing packages stayed intact. |
| Visual and source review | All three recording frames, actual desktop inspector, actual Seeker age, and local mobile start page were inspected. Changed JavaScript syntax and `git diff --check` passed. Primary review checked source reset, race guards, truth boundaries, field selection, and scope. No independent review was repeated. |

Final inspector ZIP SHA256: `ae15268c59690415611b85f99a4121bbf28c8cbc3e2ed3ce715cb4702ce5eedf`.
Screenshots, actual query reports, and recording frames remain in ignored local storage.
The earlier continuous paid footage remains unchanged. It records actual fresh acceptance and expiry, rather than a refreshed archive.
The founder's physical gateway stayed active. A separate no-hardware rehearsal server now runs on port 4022.
Eligibility confirmation, narration, public test/video links, registration, project page, contact details, and human submission remain open.

## October 5 live paid run and Seeker verification

Starting source: `46ddaed81c3cad73a70c39d0233358c73a8050f7` on `main`, with the reviewed buyer-monitor changes uncommitted during capture.
The user explicitly approved one 0.001 Devnet test-USDC purchase, then authorized small Solana Devnet test transactions generally.
This continuation executed one purchase. It created no phone wallet, custom Solana program, peaq transaction, or GPIO output.

The buyer completed purchase `26e4bdea64934d52`. Its original challenge and signed GPIO9 OPEN receipt remain in the [public output](evidence/device-signed-purchase-20261005.json).
The buyer accepted the receipt at age six seconds. It paid before the gateway requested the physical observation.
The laptop and actual Seeker Chrome independently queried the same transfer and accepted the fresh result.
At 08:47:36 UTC, both showed VALID, MATCHES, 5/5 AGREE, FRESH, VERIFIED TRANSFER, and DISPATCH.
Both changed to EXPIRED and WAIT against the real clock. Tampering produced a rejected signature and WAIT.
No clock override, RPC fixture, simulated settlement, or substituted archive occurred in this capture.

[Actual Solana Devnet transaction](https://explorer.solana.com/tx/5Rqq2o1GeAX2TXDYf7NXLFAxZnunkxqQz8tpnh5musVi5poZd6jhtDs1axpFy7EHuWh4h3EU4xchbkbNpXMoXttz?cluster=devnet).
Both chain reads confirmed slot 507676124, the configured test-USDC mint, payer −1000, merchant +1000, and the matching SPL Token instruction.
The disposable buyer's confirmed test-USDC balance changed from 19.998 to 19.997. The post-purchase balance read occurred at 08:53:40 UTC.
The phone acted as a portable browser verifier through USB reverse forwarding. It supplied no sensor data and signed no payment.
The ESP32 communicated with the laptop through BLE. Its USB cable supplied power.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Initial browser check on the running gateway | Timed out because the newly requested module was absent from its loaded asset whitelist. Reusing the existing shared module restored compatibility without restarting the founder's gateway. |
| Gateway suite | `npm --prefix gateway test`: 47 passed, zero failed. Output reservation, failure preservation, public-field selection, size limits, wallet-array rejection, partial-file recovery, and absent configuration passed. |
| Test-command correction | Initial `npm test` at the repository root failed because no root test script exists. The declared gateway command passed. |
| Python launcher/export suite | 15 passed in 0.37 seconds. Host and firmware behavior did not change. The preceding full Python result remains 204 passed and ten hardware skips. |
| Buyer-monitor browser fixtures | No archive substitution, required payment check, continuous expiry, source replacement, wallet rejection, delayed RPC/signature/archive results, desktop fit, and no payment/device requests passed. |
| Signature-race regression | Removing the source-revision guard made the focused test fail: an old REJECTED result replaced NOT VERIFIED after invalid input. Restoring the guard made the test pass. |
| Gateway and prefixed static receipt inspector | Original receipt, expiry, three attacks, synchronized illustration, focus modes, input archives, damaged archives, RPC fixtures, HTTP 429 recovery, and mobile width passed. |
| Founder guide | Six steps, three rehearsal modes, eight executed software outcomes, deep references, unique anchors, desktop/mobile width, and no page errors passed. |
| Board preflight | One bounded actual BLE sample passed at 08:20:57 UTC. Device-signed OPEN, receipt age six seconds, and elapsed time 12.769 seconds. No payment occurred. |
| Actual Seeker recorded-receipt test | Chrome 150.0.7871.64 verified the October 1 signature and actual transfer. All three receipt attacks returned WAIT. No horizontal overflow occurred. |
| Actual new paid run | Independent CLI purchase, actual BLE observation, both browser transfer checks, fresh DISPATCH, real-time expiry, and altered-answer rejection passed. |
| Actual static-package inspection | Loading the October 5 public JSON produced VALID, EXPIRED, and WAIT. A read-only actual Devnet query verified slot 507676124. |
| Continuous video | Raw capture: 32.8 seconds, VP8, 1280 × 900, no audio. Full decoding passed. |
| Captioned video | Initial subtitle scaling obscured the controls. Explicit ASS canvas dimensions placed captions below unchanged footage. Final capture: 32.8 seconds, VP8, 1280 × 1000, no audio. Full decoding and Chromium metadata passed. |
| Visual inspection | Laptop and Seeker fresh-result screenshots, Seeker payment, and accepted/expired/tampered video frames passed. |
| Final static package | Twelve manifest entries and thirteen ZIP members matched every digest and archived byte. |
| Final syntax and references | Changed JavaScript syntax and `git diff --check` passed. 105 changed Markdown local references resolved. |
| Local start page | Three tasks, all local links, loaded diagram, mobile width, and no page errors passed. The eligibility note reflects the founder's reported cooldown. No exception is confirmed. |
| Review | Primary checklist and source/diff review covered file ownership, side effects, source races, trust roots, failure paths, and documentation. Independent review was not repeated after the earlier account-limit failure. |

Video, screenshots, terminal output, and raw test records remain in ignored local storage. Public links and human submission remain owner tasks.
The short capture does not replace a required 2–3 minute founder presentation. The existing longer technical walkthrough remains available.
The founder's physical gateway stayed active. No firmware, new sensor, gate actuation, peaq activation, public deployment, outreach, registration, or submission occurred.

## October 5 visual buyer decision and short proof companion

Starting source: clean `b2c1ce95dea4343a6f5d938551c668c0fda2eabd` on `main`.
The receipt inspector now illustrates the visiting robot, external operator, receipt claim, and actual buyer decision.
The scene renders the existing verifier result. It introduces no separate acceptance policy, hardware control, or clock override.
An altered claim remains visible as a claim. Failed or unavailable verification keeps the illustrated buyer at WAIT.
Receipt metadata remains available in the full view. The focused view preserves all four acceptance checks and the payment panel.
The [one-minute proof](REHEARSAL.md#explain-the-recorded-proof-in-one-minute) gives the founder a short explanation path.
The morning checklist and short video remain in ignored local storage. Public links and human submission remain unverified completion gates.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Initial presentation layout | The new scene pushed the experiment controls below the 900-pixel viewport. The existing browser assertion failed. |
| Revised presentation layout | A compact illustration and hidden duplicate metadata restored desktop fit. The default view retains the metadata. Desktop and 390-pixel mobile screenshots passed visual inspection. |
| Gateway and prefixed static inspector | Original signature, expired WAIT, three attacks, synchronized scene, focus modes, RPC fixtures, HTTP 429 recovery, both input archives, and damaged archives passed. |
| Scene acceptance branch | A fixed historical browser-clock fixture produced DISPATCH from the unchanged original receipt. Tampering returned WAIT. This is a test fixture, not fresh physical evidence. |
| Unavailable source archive | HTTP 404 produced NOT VERIFIED, an UNAVAILABLE claim, WAIT, and disabled inspector/payment controls. |
| `npm test` in `gateway` | 42 passed, zero failed in 747.387 milliseconds. |
| Focused Python launcher/export tests | 15 passed in 0.21 seconds. No host or firmware behavior changed. The previous full Python result remains 204 passed and ten hardware skips. |
| Exported guide | Six steps, three modes, eight executed software outcomes, deep references, unique anchors, desktop/mobile, and no page errors passed. |
| Static package | Eleven manifest entries and twelve ZIP members matched every digest and archived byte. |
| Local morning page | Three checkboxes, every local link, loaded diagram, desktop/mobile width, and no page errors passed. Final links and Chromium playback metadata also passed. |
| Actual Devnet query during final recording | Captured October 4, 22:53:44 UTC, or October 5, 00:53:44 CEST. One actual `getTransaction` query confirmed slot 506374923, payer −1000, merchant +1000, and the selected mint. |
| Short visual companion | The first 76.6-second capture passed decoding. Its final framing hid the peaq note behind the caption. A second capture moved the future section into view. The final video is 75.64 seconds, VP8, 1280 × 900, 25 frames/second, with no audio. Full decoding passed. |
| Final video inspection | Actual payment, original WAIT, another-key rejection, and final company/peaq-status frames passed visual inspection. |
| Recorder input boundaries | Invalid protocols, missing directory slash, URL query, and existing output failed before capture. Existing output remained intact. |
| Review and syntax | Primary source/diff review and changed JavaScript syntax checks passed. No independent review was repeated after the earlier account-limit failure. Forty-eight local Markdown paths resolved before this record update. |

The recorder permits static reads and one Devnet transaction query. Failed verification prevents a completed video.
Both captures used actual RPC responses. Neither intercepted the RPC with fixtures, changed receipt times, paid, or invoked hardware.
No firmware, GPIO output, peaq write, public deployment, registration, or submission occurred. The founder's physical gateway remained active.

## October 4 visible Solana payment and visual explanation

Starting source: clean `84a7cfed22d0410fb81e0af22f6b377b516e994f` on `main`.
The founder needs a short visual demo before the October 5 MVP deadline and identifies Munich Maker Lab as a separate venue.
The existing physical browser uses simulated settlement. It creates no new chain transaction.
The [flow picture](assets/fieldproof-payment-to-observation.svg) now shows the actual architecture: payment first, then the separate BLE request and signed answer.
The `/proof#payment` panel exposes the recorded payer, merchant, amount, Explorer link, and existing read-only chain query.
The payment panel remains visible in presentation mode. Displayed recorded terms do not claim a successful current query.
A query failure replaces the prior verified summary. The receipt's freshness and WAIT decision remain independent.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Actual Node Devnet RPC query | October 4, 20:58:34 UTC: the verifier confirmed slot 506374923, the selected mint, buyer delta −1000, and merchant delta +1000 base units. |
| Actual browser Devnet RPC query | October 4, 21:05:02 UTC: VERIFIED TRANSFER, buyer −0.001 USDC, merchant +0.001 USDC. No RPC fixture interception occurred. The expired receipt remained WAIT. |
| `npm test` in `gateway` | 42 passed, zero failed in 842.713 milliseconds. The explicit SVG route and private-path refusal passed. |
| Focused Python launcher/export tests | 15 passed in 0.28 seconds. No host or firmware behavior changed. The preceding full Python result remains 204 passed and ten hardware skips. |
| Gateway and prefixed static inspector browser checks | Recorded wallets and amount, Explorer link, visible presentation payment panel, receipt attacks, input archives, expiry, RPC fixtures, failure-summary replacement, recovery, and mobile width passed. |
| Prefixed founder guide | Six steps, three modes, eight actual fixture outcomes, deep links, unique anchors, desktop/mobile width, and no page errors passed. |
| Visual inspection | Full-size diagram and actual current-query desktop/mobile screenshots passed. |
| Static package integrity | Eleven manifest files and twelve ZIP members matched every digest and archived byte. |
| Local visual video assembly | The first concatenation ran before the introduction encoder finished and rejected the incomplete input. Assembly passed after encoder completion. |
| Local visual video | A ten-second flow picture precedes the unchanged verified 149.88-second walkthrough. `ffprobe` reported 159.88 seconds, VP8, 1280 × 900, and no audio. Full decoding passed. The picture, transition frame, and closing frame passed visual inspection. |
| Syntax and links | Changed JavaScript syntax and `git diff --check` passed. Fifty changed Markdown local links resolved before this record update. |
| Review | The requested extra independent review stopped at the account usage limit. The primary review checked the full diff, read-only payment boundary, failure summary, and explicit public asset list. No concrete remaining issue was found. |

Actual browser query log SHA256: `9c7aeb66a6ac42f81d171e735dbab6337c88c48231a6e88f270a1e48084fa96f`.

The alternative video remains in ignored local submission storage. The committed original video and its recorded evidence remain unchanged.
Its assembly uses a 25-frame-per-second, ten-second PNG introduction encoded with `libvpx`, then `ffmpeg` concatenation with stream copy.
The source screenshot comes from the new SVG. This assembly creates no payment or hardware request.

No firmware, GPIO output, new physical observation, new payment, peaq activation, public deployment, registration, or submission occurred.
The existing physical gateway belongs to the founder's active rehearsal. This continuation did not stop it or invoke its observation endpoint.
New sensors, phone sensing, and Mobile Wallet Adapter remain outside the immediate submission scope.
The [hardware plan](HARDWARE_NEXT.md#highest-value-with-almost-no-lab-time) now specifies pickup only when parts are ready.

## October 4 founder guide and self-run rehearsal

Starting source: `38ce96645d270a0895173823e97080066c04136c` on `main`.
The [illustrated guide](HOW_IT_WORKS.html) now leads with one transaction and three rehearsal stages.
It explains the separate internet/payment and direct BLE paths. Deep technical references stay collapsed.
Its six-step and eight-case panels are labeled teaching models. The receipt inspector performs actual browser verification.
The new `scripts/demo.py` launcher provides prerequisite checks, simulation, bounded board input, physical-browser rehearsal, software cases, and the guide.
It never pays, flashes firmware, drives a GPIO output, retries failed input, or replaces physical failure with simulation.
The [demo runbook](DEMO.md#use-the-rehearsal-launcher) owns launcher modes and recovery.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| `python3 scripts/demo.py check` | Three prerequisite checks passed. No radio or payment. |
| `python3 scripts/demo.py cases` | All eight executed signed-fixture scenarios matched the guide. Fresh OPEN produced DISPATCH. The other seven final outcomes produced WAIT. No physical boards participated. |
| `python3 scripts/demo.py board --expect open` | One bounded real BLE observation passed. GPIO9 reported OPEN, five matching samples, pinned P-256 identity, and five-second age. |
| Board timing | Discovery and manifest: 8.707 seconds. Invocation and delivery: 3.998 seconds. Total BLE path: 12.705 seconds. Worker: 12.778 seconds. |
| Launcher restart regression before the fix | A stopped server's TIME_WAIT connection caused false port refusal. The focused test failed with address already in use. |
| Launcher restart after the fix | The probe enables address reuse. The focused regression passed. Active listeners remain refused. Independent review also checked loopback and wildcard listeners with address reuse. |
| Actual guide-link regression before the fix | `/learn` returned the source guide, but its `PEAQ_INTEGRATION.md` link returned 404. |
| Guide links after the fix | Known references link to the public repository. The recorded inspector stays on the current gateway port. Local public assets return 200. Private paths remain 404. |
| Real guide export regression before the fix | Export rejected the newly linked hardware guide. The actual-source test reproduced the missing allowlist entry. |
| Guide export after the fix | The explicit hardware reference links to the public repository. Unknown or private local references still fail. No additional directories are copied. |
| Focused launcher and export tests | 15 passed in 0.20 seconds. Child failures, wrong physical action, invalid identity, malformed state, occupied port, restart, and export boundaries are covered. |
| `uv run --project host pytest -q` | 204 passed, ten hardware tests skipped in 2.12 seconds. The separate real-input checks above and below supplied this continuation's hardware evidence. |
| `npm test` in `gateway` | 42 passed, zero failed in 706.577 milliseconds. |
| Guide browser QA | Source, gateway, and prefixed static export passed six steps, three modes, eight executed fixture outcomes, deep links, unique anchors, desktop/mobile widths, and no page errors. |
| Simulated browser purchase | Launcher on port 4035 passed configured terms, OPEN/DISPATCH, expired WAIT, desktop/mobile widths, and no page errors. No hardware or funds. |
| Physical browser rehearsal | Launcher on port 4023 passed a mock-payment purchase with actual GPIO9 OPEN, a v3 device signature, pinned identity, DISPATCH, then expired WAIT. No page errors. |
| Prefixed recorded inspector | Signature, challenge, expiry, three attacks, both recorded input states, damaged archives, focus controls, RPC fixtures, HTTP 429 recovery, and mobile width passed. This QA does not claim a new live chain query. |
| Export navigation and integrity | Guide → actual inspector → guide passed under a URL prefix. Ten manifest files and eleven ZIP members matched every digest and archived byte. |
| Visual inspection | Source desktop, transaction panel, source mobile, exported mobile, and actual physical OPEN screenshots passed inspection. |
| Independent fix review | Both concrete rehearsal findings were resolved. The reviewer ran all 15 focused Python and 42 gateway tests. No further concrete finding remained. |
| Final independent adversarial review | No concrete P1/P2 finding remained. The launcher preserves failures and simulated settlement. Gateway and export changes preserve public asset boundaries. |
| Documentation and syntax | 119 changed-document local links resolved. Changed Python sources parsed. JavaScript syntax and `git diff --check` passed. |

The bounded board log started at October 4, 17:50:55 UTC. It records clean tracked source `38ce966`.
The new launcher was untracked at that time. Host and firmware file hashes remain in the ignored raw log.
Raw board-log SHA256: `371dd78cc2458a2c1e66b4050572dafc86c7b5e167de55c0ebb2cf03eb870d4d`.
The physical-browser result was captured at October 4, 18:13:42 UTC, against `38ce966` with tracked rehearsal changes.
Physical-browser result SHA256: `b19f75d05fbcae727e1cb3cd95b5e65e8c321b430d894339b0e0458fd8be0a42`.
Final founder-package ZIP SHA256: `615a24a90ca5c5869a17853b86314c08e384925682b1cf75400eeec060a1211d`.
The technical video remains unchanged, with SHA256 `42e7ec97daacd0cb04d5af39d50ebae1c9dc127d6e552f47aa9219b49357159b`.

These checks add no external gate, second physical observer, capacity benchmark, phone-sensor adapter, or production authorization.
They do not explain or fix the earlier overnight discovery miss. The October 2 human-held CLOSED evidence remains the physical closed-state record.
This continuation performed no actual payment, firmware change, output operation, peaq write, publication, registration, or submission.
Public links, human registration, and the submission receipt remain separate completion gates.
Owned test gateways stopped after verification. No background hardware lane remains active. The founder can start the default simulator in its own terminal.

## October 4 focused demo and current device readiness

Starting source: `cd43b2f4c7019232fe02619062c5e3b29781a987` on `main`.
The [documentation guide](README.md) now provides one short reading path and a canonical reference map.
The [strategy](STRATEGY.md#the-wedge-to-test-first) specifies the first pilot hypothesis: a visiting robot at another operator's loading gate.
Existing infrastructure integrations and machine-service markets remain relevant alternatives. No uncrowded-market claim exists.
The [hardware plan](HARDWARE_NEXT.md#decide-in-one-minute-today) preserves BOOT and identifies optional borrowed contacts and phone uses.
MakerSpace's published Sunday/Monday closure places its next regular opening after the Germany deadline. Special access remains unverified.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Missing public diagram regression | The live gateway returned 404. The focused asset test failed with `404 != 200` before the fix. |
| Explicit public asset routes | Both diagrams now return 200 with SVG content type. Private paths remain 404. The focused regression passed. Fix commit: `c4d44cc`. |
| `npm test` in `gateway` | 41 passed, zero failed in 664.887 milliseconds. Independent review also ran all 41 tests successfully. |
| `uv run --project host pytest -q tests/test_judge_export.py` | Two passed in 0.01 seconds. No Python behavior changed in this continuation. |
| `scripts/check_receipt_ui.cjs`, local gateway and final prefixed export | Original signature, expiry, state/challenge/key attacks, focus toggle/direct link, desktop fit, both signed input states, damaged archives, RPC fixtures, HTTP 429 recovery, and mobile width passed. |
| Read-only independent review | No concrete P1/P2 issue remained. Its separate browser probe preserved VALID/MATCHES/EXPIRED/WAIT and rejected altered evidence. |
| Real ESP32 readiness sample | One scheduled sample passed. GPIO9 reported OPEN, five of five matching samples, pinned P-256 identity, and four-second evidence age. |
| Readiness timing | Discovery and manifest: 8.551 seconds. Invocation and delivery: 3.997 seconds. Total BLE path: 12.548 seconds. Worker: 12.627 seconds. |
| New technical recording | Every scene assertion passed. The quote is simulated and unpaid. The actual Devnet purchase and reset checks remain recorded evidence. Capture invoked no hardware or payment. |
| Video inspection | The first candidate had an offscreen quote and clipped closing details. The revised capture fixed both. Eight final frames passed visual inspection. |
| Final video decode and metadata | Full `ffmpeg` decode passed. `ffprobe` reported 149.88 seconds, VP8, 1280 × 900, and no audio stream. The exported video loaded the same metadata in Chromium. |
| Final static package | Nine manifest assets and ten ZIP members. Every digest and archived byte matched. Desktop and mobile focus screenshots passed visual inspection. |
| Documentation and syntax | 109 local link targets had no missing files before the final verification update. Changed JavaScript syntax checks and `git diff --check` passed. |

The readiness command was `uv run --project host python scripts/soak_observations.py --count 1 --interval 1 --output .local/soak/oct04-demo-readiness.jsonl`.
It started at October 4, 09:33:50 UTC. The log records `cd43b2f` and tracked documentation/web changes.
Host and firmware sources remained unchanged. The log preserves their exact file hashes and runtime versions.
Raw-log SHA256: `d051e77f5c2e08bfd0ffac947a99a4d71dd99360754fe99c9084018a73b76005`.
This single sample does not establish an external gate or fix the earlier overnight discovery miss.
No background hardware lane remains active.

The focused inspector uses the same verifier and current-time freshness limit. The complete measurement date stays visible.
It hides reference sections only. **Show full page** restores the payment query, input archive, public pin, and key-storage warning.
The revised video replaces the current walkthrough. Git history and an ignored local backup preserve the prior version.
Video SHA256: `42e7ec97daacd0cb04d5af39d50ebae1c9dc127d6e552f47aa9219b49357159b`.
Final local ZIP SHA256: `821290e26e0f08bb6e68dc353eba150d74d27c5c60c98640b8cf550d77c533df`.

No new payment, firmware change, output GPIO operation, peaq write, public deployment, registration, or submission occurred.
Public Pages publication awaits explicit approval. Human eligibility, project, contact, and submission fields remain incomplete.
The latest full Python result remains 191 passed and ten hardware skips from the preceding source checkpoint.

## October 4 physical-service story and offline peaq inputs

Starting source: clean `c6195e68ef329571ed5677e5e197aa48d40eabee`, confirmed against the remote branch.
The [strategy](STRATEGY.md) now owns the cross-operator physical-service hypothesis and enterprise-first commercial test.
The [source check](research/2026-10-04-physical-services.md) records the VDA scope boundary and Open-RMF infrastructure integrations.
The current product remains one observation purchase. Access, reservation, actuation, and completed-service evidence remain future work.

The new offline peaq preparer preserves the exact observer identity subject and binds its public key to a named BLE service.
It creates no SDK client, account, connection, preview, or transaction.
SDK validation requires explicit public controller and manufacturer claims plus a net-bond bound.
The remaining write gates stay in the [peaq guide](PEAQ_INTEGRATION.md#decision-required-before-a-write).

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Focused input and export checks, first run | Collection failed because the new test imported the repository scripts outside pytest's path. The scoped test loader now supplies the repository path. |
| `uv run --project host pytest -q tests/test_peaq_identity_inputs.py tests/test_judge_export.py` | 13 passed in 0.04 seconds after the loader correction. |
| Malformed pin-container regressions before the fix | Four cases failed with `AttributeError`. Shared subject validation now requires both JSON containers to be objects. |
| `uv run --project host pytest -q tests/test_peaq_readiness.py tests/test_peaq_identity_inputs.py tests/test_judge_export.py` | 29 passed in 0.07 seconds after the boundary fix. |
| `uv run --project host pytest -q`, final candidate | 191 passed, 10 hardware tests skipped in 2.03 seconds. |
| Public key format | Independent decoding recovered the exact pinned P-256 point. The W3C published Multikey example re-encoded exactly. |
| Isolated `peaq-os-sdk==0.10.0` validation | Explicit fixture addresses and bond bound passed the actual SDK input validator and DID struct encoder with socket connections blocked. No operator was selected. |
| Default preparer CLI | Exit zero. Public draft leaves controller, manufacturer, and spending bound unset. `sdk_validation: not_run`, `activated: false`. |
| Read-only specialist review | The malformed-container finding was reproduced and fixed. Follow-up found no remaining concrete issue. All four malformed CLI files exited 1 without draft output. |
| Simulated browser purchase | Configured quote, simulated DISPATCH, expired WAIT, desktop/mobile widths, and no page errors passed. The script checked simulator mode before purchase. |
| Prefixed static-export browser checks | Authentic recorded receipt, expiry, altered state/challenge/key, both input states, damaged input archives, RPC fixtures, HTTP 429 recovery, and unchanged WAIT passed. |
| Final static-export integrity | Nine manifest assets and ten ZIP members. Every file digest matched. The packaged diagram matched its reviewed source. |
| Native SVG and explainer checks | Desktop and 390-pixel layouts passed. Visual inspection found crowded diagram labels. Shorter labels passed a card-bound check and repeat rendering. |
| Local founder handout | Current/future flow controls and all eight fixture choices passed. No horizontal overflow or page errors occurred. This remains local preparation material. |
| Python compilation and diff whitespace | Passed for changed scripts. No formatter or type checker is declared. |

The SDK fixture uses a synthetic controller and an explicitly supplied zero manufacturer field. It is not an operator identity or an activation preview.
The service URI labels a local BLE capability. No public gateway endpoint or automatic registry discovery exists.
The buyer's independently provisioned key remains the trust root. Registration cannot establish installation or physical truth.

Both complete public bounty listing payloads were checked again on October 4.
Deadlines and human submission requirements remain in [submission preparation](SUBMISSION.md#verified-requirements-and-deadlines).
Competition status does not establish winning odds, demand, or customer traction.

No new physical measurement, payment, output GPIO operation, firmware change, peaq write, deployment, registration, or submission occurred in this change.
The unchanged Node suite's latest executed result remains 41 passing tests. This entry adds browser checks for revised prose and package assets.

## October 3 post-review single-board check

The reviewed source `75cde7e668eef10032a0ff5c7ee3a55232d52a43` passed three scheduled real BLE observations after the overnight lane ended.
The source was clean. The new shared worker helper ran against the attached board.
The diagnostic returned exit code zero with three passes and zero failures.
All receipts reported `gpio9-contact` at five seconds of age under the unchanged ten-second limit.
Worker durations were 12.135, 11.959, and 12.003 seconds.
No payment, output GPIO, firmware change, or second-board collection occurred.

The complete log remains in ignored local storage.
Raw-log SHA256: `f7e8adfc7d3e64edbcfa1dbcdb9c976dd858b845277857fb6561dd703287e36b`.
These passes verify normal worker completion on hardware. Software-child regressions verify cancellation and termination failures.
They do not establish a fix for the overnight discovery miss.

## October 3 completed overnight baseline

The fixed-source lane completed all 120 scheduled samples. It returned exit code one because one sample failed.
Source: clean `1624b15df8f5e51afcc8ec11ab71a147b73f03f3`.
The run started October 2 at 21:09:44 UTC. The final sample started October 3 at 01:34:12 UTC.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Scheduled real BLE observations | 119 passed, one failed. No terminal retry or simulated replacement occurred. |
| Accepted evidence age | Five or six seconds under the unchanged ten-second limit. |
| Accepted worker duration | Minimum 12.551 seconds, median 12.925 seconds, maximum 17.899 seconds. |
| Failure | Sample 80 failed after 4.304 seconds because discovery returned no manifest for the selected ESP32. |
| Recovery | The next scheduled sample passed. Every remaining sample passed. |
| Runtime | Python 3.13.13, Bleak 3.0.2, cryptography 50.0.1. |
| Preservation | The complete raw log and summary remain in ignored local storage. The clean detached worktree was removed after preservation. |

Raw-log SHA256: `1a6ad2f7abb7d77f94c30ecc7c67332659a8133e55846034e40575e8597b3775`.
The log has no lower-level radio or operating-system evidence for the discovery miss. Its underlying cause remains unverified.
This run establishes observed behavior under these conditions. It does not establish uninterrupted availability or production reliability.
The run performed no payment, output GPIO operation, or firmware change.
Its source excludes the newer main-branch worker cleanup fixes and unpaid pair collector.

## October 3 unpaid concurrent BLE pair runner

Starting source: `fdc0c1c`, pushed and confirmed against the remote branch.
The diagnostic snapshots the selected public pins, discovers once, and invokes two selected BLE providers concurrently.
It retains the buyer's original challenges and evaluates both responses after collection.
A bounded parent process reports unmet policy as JSON and exposes unconfirmed cleanup separately from WAIT.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| Reproduced defects before fixes | Five regression cases failed: reflected command tokens, three nonfinite JSON values, and falsely confirmed cleanup after a signal error. |
| `uv run --project host pytest -q tests/test_pair_collection.py tests/test_observation_soak.py`, before four additional cases | 40 passed in 0.68 seconds after fixes. |
| `uv run --project host pytest -q tests/test_pair_collection.py tests/test_observation_soak.py`, final focused suite | 46 passed in 0.78 seconds. |
| `uv run --project host pytest -q`, final suite | 176 passed, 10 hardware tests skipped in 1.51 seconds. |
| Actual BLE adapter with SDK fixtures | One scanner call, two cached BLE handles, overlapping invocations, and two independently signed fixture responses produced DISPATCH. No physical radio access occurred. |
| Collection failure and mutation | Missing, duplicate, or incapable providers stopped both invocations. A failed member preserved the peer. Adapter mutation did not replace original challenges. |
| Final-time freshness | Both fixture responses became stale at the final evaluation time and produced WAIT. |
| Public diagnostic output | Reflected tokens in nested values, keys, unsigned fields, and an invalid signature were redacted. Nonfinite envelopes produced strict JSON WAIT. |
| Worker recovery | Unconfirmed termination, failed signaling, failed wait, or missing exit status exposed cleanup failure and a worker PID. Confirmed exit preserved the deadline failure. |
| Cancellation regression | Two real software-child cases failed before the fix. Single or repeated cancellation during TERM cleanup now completed KILL and reaping before returning cancellation. |
| Read-only specialist review | No concrete P1/P2 issue remained in token redaction or worker cleanup after follow-up. |
| `uv run --project host python -m scripts.check_contact_pair --help` | Exit zero. The public flags and prerequisite description displayed. |
| Unprovisioned-provider CLI check | Exit two before worker or BLE access. The error required each selected provider's independently provisioned public pin. |

The fixtures used temporary signing keys in memory. No device access, output GPIO, payment, firmware flash, or peaq write occurred.
The [pair guide](CORROBORATION.md#collect-two-provisioned-ble-contacts-once) owns commands, output semantics, deadlines, and recovery.
The gateway still sells one provider per purchase. Actual two-board timing, physical disagreement, and paired payments remain open.
The unchanged Node suite's latest executed result remains 41 passing tests in the compatibility section below.

The separate fixed-source overnight lane reached 56 observed passes and zero failures at this checkpoint.
No terminal summary was observed. Its running source excludes the newer main-branch cleanup fix.
This checkpoint does not claim a completed soak or validation of that fix on hardware.

## October 3 peaq ownership boundary

Starting source: `ad31124`, pushed and confirmed against the remote branch.
The diagnostic now reads the proposed identity's owner through the published SDK's read-only context.
Every contract call uses the same finalized block. No signing account or invented legacy address exists in this path.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| `uv run --project host pytest -q tests/test_peaq_readiness.py` | 12 passed in 0.06 seconds |
| `uv run --project host pytest -q` | 146 passed, 10 hardware tests skipped in 1.52 seconds |
| Isolated SDK 0.10.0 live diagnostic | Exit zero at finalized Agung block 10,997,811, chain ID 9990. |
| Registry state | `MACHINE_NOT_FOUND` with decoded `ERC721NonexistentToken`. No local token exists at this block. |
| Identity and economics | Proposed identity bytes and ID unchanged. Full tier-0 bond remained 0.4 native test tokens. Authority passed and both technical pause flags remained false. |
| Error and RPC fixtures | Decoded absence, registered owner, and foreign home stayed distinct. RPC failures propagated. Different-block calls, state overrides, and transaction methods failed before network access. |
| Read-only specialist review | No high-confidence P1/P2 issue remained. The reviewer exercised actual SDK registered, nonexistent, foreign-home, and failed reads with a fake provider. Every contract call stayed pinned. |

The [public snapshot](evidence/peaq-agung-readiness.json) replaces the earlier readiness snapshot.
No activation, reservation, approval, signature, account funding, service registration, or activity event occurred.
An absent ID is not reserved and establishes no future availability. The [peaq guide](PEAQ_INTEGRATION.md) owns the remaining write gates.

A local founder handout now explains the payment/evidence distinction, technical demonstration, commercial questions, and captured fixture decisions.
All eight scene controls passed desktop and 390-pixel browser checks. Both screenshots were inspected.
No page errors, horizontal overflow, or HTTP requests occurred. The handout performs no live verification, hardware access, or payment.
It remains local preparation material and is not part of the public judge export.

## October 3 bounded two-observer policy

Starting source: `59990ff`, pushed and confirmed against the remote branch.
The new policy requires two distinct configured provider IDs and public P-256 pins.
It verifies original challenges, exact sensors, stable samples, and both ages at one evaluation time.
The default completion-time difference is at most two seconds. Only two acceptable OPEN receipts produce DISPATCH.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| `uv run --project host pytest -q tests/test_corroboration.py` | 42 passed in 0.23 seconds |
| `uv run --project host pytest -q` | 140 passed, 10 hardware tests skipped in 1.46 seconds |
| `uv run --project host capmesh corroborate-demo --scenario all` | Exit zero. Eight labeled signed-fixture scenarios returned their expected decisions and specific reasons. |
| Pair recovery and reuse | Failed partial pairs preserved a valid member. Complete CLOSED or conflicting pairs consumed both tokens. A fresh pair still worked. |
| Concurrent verification and caller mutation | One of two concurrent consumers returned DISPATCH. The other rejected replay. Caller mutation did not change the captured authenticated decision. |
| Pair expiry | The oldest receipt or earliest request expiration bounded validity. The next second produced WAIT. |
| Malformed contact regression | Before the fix, positive and negative infinity raised `OverflowError`. After strict Boolean canonicalization, seven malformed values returned WAIT and preserved valid-pair recovery. |
| Read-only specialist review | Identity and verification reviewers reproduced the malformed-contact defect. The focused suites confirmed the fix. |
| Explanation page | Desktop and 390-pixel browser checks passed. Both screenshots were inspected. No page error or horizontal overflow occurred. |

Fixture signing keys remained in memory. No hardware, network request, wallet access, payment, firmware flash, or peaq write occurred in this feature's checks.
At this checkpoint, the gateway and paid buyer served one provider per purchase. No paired payment or collector existed.
The [pair guide](CORROBORATION.md) owns the rule and physical gates. Distinct keys do not establish independent physical sensing or calibrated confidence.
The unchanged Node suite's latest executed result remains 41 passing tests in the compatibility section below.

The separate fixed-source overnight diagnostic remains in progress. Its first 35 observed samples passed, with zero failures at this checkpoint.
No terminal summary was observed. This is progress evidence, not a completed soak result.

## October 3 recorded-purchase compatibility

Starting source: `d019109`, pushed and confirmed against the remote branch.
Two new regression tests use the actual committed device-signed paid receipt.
They exercise the current Node buyer and explicit GPIO9 Python contract with the installed public pin.

| Check | Observed result |

| `uv run --project host pytest -q` | 98 passed, 10 hardware tests skipped in 1.87 seconds |
| `npm --prefix gateway test` | 41 passed, 0 failed in 937.23 milliseconds |
| Historical acceptance time | Both runtimes reproduced the recorded DISPATCH at seven seconds of age. |
| Eleven-second age and configured GPIO18 mismatch | Both runtimes rejected the original receipt. A valid signature did not override either contract. |
| Separate current-time check | Both runtimes rejected the authentic recorded receipt as expired. No new observation or payment occurred. |

The tests use an explicit historical time only to verify compatibility with the recorded result.
Current user-facing inspection remains expired WAIT. The tests neither refresh the timestamp nor create new physical evidence.
The full simulator, overnight source isolation, and pending physical extension gates remain unchanged.

## October 2–3 configured contact and quote boundaries

Starting source: `c21c4d9`. The attached firmware, signing pin, and fixed-source overnight diagnostic remain unchanged.
The new software selects a physical provider, exact input descriptor, and independently provisioned public key.
It supports separate public pins for additional providers. No second physical device or external fixture was tested.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| `uv run --project host pytest -q`, final expanded suite | 97 passed, 10 hardware tests skipped in 1.87 seconds |
| `npm --prefix gateway test`, final expanded suite | 40 passed, 0 failed in 956.39 milliseconds |
| Default ESP-IDF 6.1 GPIO9 build | Passed. Binary size `0x1371c0`. No flash. |
| Isolated ESP-IDF 6.1 GPIO18 build | Passed. Configuration confirms GPIO18. Binary size `0x1371d0`. No flash. |
| Isolated GPIO12 negative build | Expected rejection. Compiler stopped at the supported-input static assertion. `idf.py` exited 2. |
| Configured signed test receipts | Exact GPIO18/provider/key accepted. Wrong sensors, provider IDs, keys, and challenges rejected. Software fixtures only. |
| Purchase configuration and migration | Terms survived reopening. Provider, sensor, or pin changes rejected old quotes before payment. Legacy rows survived migration. Cached delivery remained retrievable. |
| Buyer/gateway different-key regression | Reproduced settlement before independent receipt rejection in the candidate. Fixed handshake rejects before quote creation or paid fetch. |
| Gateway CLI invalid-provider preflight | Exited before contacting the instrumented facilitator. Zero facilitator requests. |
| Mixed live/simulated contract regression | Reproduced a LIVE CONTACT DEMO label on simulated evidence with a valid test signature. Strict mode guards now reject before transport or ledger creation. |
| Browser startup regression | Delayed `/health` reproduced an enabled quote button before configuration. The new readiness assertion failed before the fix and passed afterward. |
| Default browser simulation | Configured terms, OPEN/DISPATCH, expired WAIT, desktop and phone width passed. No funds or hardware. |
| Custom-provider closed browser simulation | `sim-secondary`, configured terms, CLOSED/WAIT, expired WAIT, desktop and phone width passed. No funds or hardware. |
| Browser checker against real Devnet mode | Expected refusal before browser launch or purchase creation. Only `/health` was read. |
| Recorded browser inspector regression | Original signature, expiry, attacks, both signed BOOT states, damaged archives, RPC fixtures and 429 recovery passed. No new payment or hardware. |
| Current public-facilitator preflight | Exact x402 V2 Devnet USDC quote for 1,000 base units passed with the selected contact and pin. No payment signature, settlement, or measurement. |
| Current read-only Agung diagnostic | Finalized block 10,997,348. Chain 9990, peers matched, pause flags false, authority true, bond unchanged. Proposed default ID remained unchanged. No activation. |
| JavaScript syntax, Python compilation, and diff whitespace | Passed for touched runtime and check scripts. No formatter or type checker is declared. |

The unpaid public quote has purchase ID `dfab502ace9a49a1`.
Read-only ledger inspection confirmed `quoted`, with null proof, settlement, and result fields.
The temporary real gateway and custom-provider simulator were stopped after verification.
The default full simulator remains available for rehearsal. It invokes no hardware.

Both candidate builds used the reviewed source changes before commit. Their application version metadata identifies `c21c4d9-dirty`.
The unflashed GPIO9 binary SHA256 is `1f9ad627cc133fddfa6041cc859a7e1f24c2d7d0e2382dc8574bf0cde5051cb7`.
The unflashed GPIO18 binary SHA256 is `b3bff73c87b7586b65d6a299ab3227d5c929ffa2610189dc4e61a34c44a15267`.
These hashes do not describe the currently flashed board.
Firmware compile checks establish configuration and build validity. They do not establish wiring or physical sampling on GPIO18.

Independent review also corrected the new-board provisioning procedure and gateway validation order.
The buyer compares its existing trusted pin with the quote. It never provisions from the echoed key.
The gateway snapshots that pin and stores it with each quote. The bridge does not reload a changed pin file after settlement.
Legacy default requests retain compatibility. Nondefault physical profiles require explicit contact and public-pin terms.
Actual device unavailability or incorrect firmware settings can still cause paid delivery failure and manual refund review.

The exact configuration and physical acceptance procedure lives in [contact setup](CONTACT_SETUP.md).
The current hardware remains GPIO9. The standalone recorded inspector remains bound to the original device and recorded evidence.
No new payment, GPIO20 output, firmware flash, reset, peaq write, deployment, registration, or submission occurred in this change.

## October 2 BLE delivery and unattended diagnostic

Starting source: `a7cba3d`. The board firmware and public pin remain unchanged.
The adapter passed address strings to Bleak after it already discovered the device.
Bleak then scanned implicitly for both manifest and invocation connections.
The revised adapter uses the discovered handle within the same event loop.
Other loops retain the address fallback because CoreBluetooth handles belong to their discovery loop.
[Official Bleak client behavior](https://bleak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/client.html)

Two transport regressions failed before handle reuse. Both passed after the change.
Review caught a cross-loop compatibility defect before commit. Its regression failed before loop binding and passed afterward.
Linux hardware verification passed. No actual macOS hardware test occurred.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| `uv run --project host pytest -q`, final candidate | 74 passed, 10 hardware tests skipped in 1.82 seconds |
| Full `--hardware` suite after loop binding, before 16 new diagnostic software cases | 68 passed in 106.65 seconds |
| Instrumented earlier observation | 15.349 seconds total, two implicit scans totaling 1.961 seconds, five-second accepted evidence age |
| Revised direct diagnostic | 12.256 seconds total, zero implicit scans, P-256 signature accepted, five-second evidence age |
| `soak_observations.py --count 3 --interval 3`, real board | Three passes, zero failures. Worker durations: 14.484, 12.989, and 12.040 seconds. Each accepted age: five seconds. |
| Independent pilot-log re-verification | All three signatures, challenges, sample counts, historical decisions, and freshness checks passed. Zero implicit scans. |
| Focused unattended-runner tests | 16 passed. Bounds, uncooperative workers, pipe failures, cleanup failure, log refusal, and failure preservation passed. |

The measurements demonstrate scan removal. They do not establish a latency distribution or service-level guarantee.
Connection setup and disconnect cleanup remain material costs. The intermittent discovery miss remains a separate reliability limit.
The short pilot reads only the current BOOT state. It does not replace the earlier held/released checks.

Review reproduced two defects in the candidate diagnostic before any radio pilot:

- An async timeout waited indefinitely for cancellation cleanup. Each observation now runs in an isolated worker with bounded termination.
- A pipe error left the worker alive before another sample. The runner now verifies reaping independently and cleans up every post-spawn exception.

The runner preserves failures and stops after three consecutive failures.
Unreapable cleanup stops the run immediately. A scheduled sample uses a new challenge, not a retry of a failed observation.
The pilot log records candidate-source hashes and its dirty-state flag. Raw logs remain ignored local state.
The [diagnostic runbook](DEMO.md#record-scheduled-input-checks) owns commands, interruption, and log interpretation.
No overnight completion is claimed from this three-sample pilot.
The longer diagnostic started from a clean detached snapshot at `1624b15` with its own installed host environment.
That snapshot passed 74 software tests with 10 hardware skips in 1.99 seconds.
Its first real observation passed. The schedule requests 120 observations with 120-second gaps.
The running process holds a sleep inhibitor. It changes no persistent power settings.
The detached source remains fixed while development continues. Raw logs and live process state remain local.
The final completed count and failure record require inspection after the run ends.
No payment, firmware flash, board reset, GPIO output, peaq write, deployment, registration, or submission occurred during the pilot.
The full legacy hardware suite includes GPIO8 actuator tests. It issued no GPIO20 operation.

## October 2 input-pair inspector and founder rehearsal

Starting source: `6b9d284`, pushed and confirmed against the remote branch.
The inspector now verifies both recorded physical input states with the same provisioned P-256 key.
It displays neither state unless the complete pair passes. Both expired observations remain WAIT.
The [rehearsal guide](REHEARSAL.md) separates simulation, actual test payment, unpaid input checks, and peaq readiness.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| `uv run --project host pytest -q` | 54 passed, 10 hardware tests skipped in 1.19 seconds |
| `npm --prefix gateway test` | 26 passed, 0 failed in 648.11 milliseconds |
| Browser regression against gateway and final static export | Original receipt, attacks, both input states, three damaged input archives, payment fixtures, 429 recovery, and phone width passed |
| Complete browser simulation | Quote, simulated purchase, DISPATCH, then expired WAIT passed. No funds or hardware. |
| Current browser public Devnet query | Exact recorded transfer verified. The expired receipt remained WAIT. No funds moved. |
| Both simulated CLI contact states, in-memory ledger | OPEN/DISPATCH and CLOSED/WAIT passed. Stale provider rejected. All reported attacks passed. |
| Export manifest and ZIP | Eight public asset hashes and all nine ZIP members matched. Archive integrity passed. |

The final export has 7,911,926 bytes and SHA256 `180106a7b8e2f35c7ec078222f03b00145ac8f9cf951a0bff5187d22ce3f2d47`.
The paid-result video remains unchanged. It does not contain the new input-pair scene.
The RPC fixtures test browser recovery. The separate current chain query establishes the live read result.
The first simulation harness used a nonexistent selector. The corrected harness used the actual `observe` control and passed.
No new payment, physical measurement, peaq write, deployment, registration, or submission occurred in this change.

## October 2 review before push

Review scope: all five unpublished commits from `origin/main` at `fa9eecf` through `4b0e02e`, plus the fixes below.
Independent passes covered identity/security, tests, API/demo contracts, and adversarial failure paths.
A separate read-only CLI review found no concrete new P1/P2 defect in its scope.
The review found and corrected these defects:

- The peaq diagnostic accepted an off-curve P-256 point. A new regression failed before curve validation and passed afterward.
- Setup commands changed directories before later commands assumed the repository root. Commands now preserve the starting directory.
- Live setup omitted trusted pin provisioning for another board. The guide now states that prerequisite explicitly.
- The guide labeled an older firmware hash as current and duplicated stale test counts. It now links the canonical results.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| `uv run --project host pytest -q`, after fixes | 54 passed, 10 hardware tests skipped in 1.17 seconds |
| `npm --prefix gateway test` | 26 passed, 0 failed in 646.49 milliseconds |
| Full `--hardware` suite, before three new software-only pin rejection cases | 61 passed in 126.04 seconds |
| Focused legacy policy hardware test | Passed in 34.03 seconds after the first full run missed the board |
| ESP-IDF dependency check and firmware build | Requirements satisfied. Build completed. No flash occurred. |
| Revised peaq diagnostic, isolated SDK 0.10.0 | Public Agung reads completed after public-point validation. No writes occurred. |
| Browser inspector regression | Original, attacks, expiry, payment fixtures, 429 recovery, and phone width passed |
| Revised setup guide | Relative links, HTML/Markdown anchors, desktop/mobile layout, and zero page errors passed |

The first full hardware run had 60 passes and one legacy policy discovery failure.
The focused rerun and next full run passed. The intermittent discovery miss remains a rehearsal reliability limit.
No blind retry or simulated substitution entered the physical path.

The standard ESP-IDF activation failed because this machine uses Espressif Installation Manager's tool layout.
The installer's generated activation script selected its tool, constraint, and Python paths.
The explicit dependency check and subsequent build passed. No dependency check was disabled.
The rebuilt binary was not flashed. The device firmware evidence below still identifies the earlier flashed artifact.
No new payment, peaq activation, deployment, registration, or submission occurred during this review.

## October 2 device, inspector, and peaq continuation

Starting source: `844fdc6`. No firmware or payment-path behavior changed in this continuation.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| `uv run --project host pytest -q --hardware` | 57 passed in 116.87 seconds before the four new packaging/readiness cases |
| `uv run --project host pytest -q`, expanded final software suite | 51 passed, 10 hardware tests skipped in 1.19 seconds |
| `npm test` in `gateway`, expanded final suite | 26 passed, 0 failed in 941.99 milliseconds |
| Held BOOT, `scripts/check_device_latency.py` | Real BLE input. P-256 signature verified. CLOSED, WAIT, 5/5 agreement, five-second evidence age. |
| Released BOOT, separate diagnostic | Real BLE input. P-256 signature verified. OPEN, DISPATCH, 5/5 agreement, four-second evidence age. |
| Recorded inspector, actual public Devnet RPC | VERIFIED TRANSFER. Slot 506374923, successful execution, expected mint, payer −1000 and merchant +1000 base units. |
| Final `querySettlement` module, live Devnet RPC | The actual transaction passed the final strict response and transfer checks. No funds moved. |
| `scripts/check_receipt_ui.cjs`, gateway | Original, expiry, altered state, another challenge, another key, restored original, and phone width passed. No page errors. |
| Same browser check, exported `/judge-demo-v2/index.html` under a URL prefix | All receipt, RPC fixture, retry, and phone-width checks passed. |
| Browser payment-check fixtures | Exact transfer passed. HTTP 429 produced NOT VERIFIED. Manual retry passed. Receipt remained expired WAIT throughout. |
| `tests/test_judge_export.py` | Public whitelist and URL paths passed. Existing directory and archive refusal passed. No private fixture entered the ZIP. |
| `tests/test_peaq_readiness.py` | RPC write/signing refusal and identity-input binding passed. No SDK dependency entered the MVP environment. |
| `scripts/check_peaq_readiness.py`, isolated SDK 0.10.0 | Agung chain 9990, finalized block 10996074, seven contracts contain code, six peer addresses match, economic authority true, both pause flags false. |
| Documented `uv run --no-project --with peaq-os-sdk==0.10.0` command | Installed the isolated SDK and completed the public read-only diagnostic successfully. |
| Committed contact-state re-verification | Both original signatures, challenges, historical decisions, and ten-second expiry passed. |
| How-it-works browser review | All 16 relative document links and section anchors passed. Desktop and 390 × 844 views were visually inspected. |
| Export manifest and ZIP | All seven asset hashes and every ZIP member match the exported files. No private state appears in the whitelist. |
| Final export video in Chromium | Metadata loaded: 149.76 seconds, 1280 × 900. |
| JavaScript syntax, Python compilation, staged diff and secret-pattern review | All passed. No formatter or static type checker is declared. |

The [device-signed contact evidence](evidence/device-signed-contact-states.json) preserves both current human-controlled readings.
These direct measurements moved no funds and issued no GPIO output operation.
The historical October 1 contact-state file retains its HMAC signatures.
The October 2 checks used the existing P-256 identity. They did not reprovision, flash, reset, or burn device security settings.
No GPIO20 output operation occurred. The unverified bare LED is not evidence of a controlled optical result.

The first hardware-suite attempt failed ten hardware cases because Bluetooth was soft-blocked and powered off.
Unblocking and powering the adapter restored access. The next full hardware run passed all 57 collected cases.
This recovery corrects local adapter state. It does not establish that Bluetooth cannot become blocked again.

The latency diagnostic measured 14.31 seconds for discovery plus the held reading, and 13.24 seconds for the released reading.
Evidence ages were five and four seconds at acceptance. These are different measurements from total operation duration.
SDK implicit scans accounted for only part of that duration. No transport optimization or independent time guarantee is claimed.

The exporter initially created a directory before it discovered an existing ZIP conflict.
A focused regression reproduced the failure. The exporter now checks both target paths before copying assets.
The package contains recorded evidence only. The full simulator separately exercises a complete purchase without funding.
The final reviewed ZIP has 7,909,635 bytes and SHA256 `cd56f54b379c82ac61f186931558a9633e03660f2c6b19eba60c6c925f055b73`.
Its video retains the current walkthrough hash listed below.

The guide initially overflowed a 390-pixel phone viewport to 741 pixels.
Wide tables and unbroken identifiers caused the overflow. Table scroll containers and identifier wrapping restored the 390-pixel page width.
The review retained visible content and table columns.

The peaq diagnostic reads public contract state and computes a proposed ID from the device public pin.
It does not query ownership, activate a machine, sign, approve a bond, submit an event, or use mainnet funds.
The [peaq readiness evidence](evidence/peaq-agung-readiness.json) and [integration decision](PEAQ_INTEGRATION.md) record exact values and remaining gates.
The SDK remains isolated from the firmware, host, and gateway dependency sets.

No new paid transfer, public deployment, external judge session, registration, or submission occurred in this continuation.

## October 2 research continuation and judge rehearsal

Current source before documentation changes: `1ef57de`.

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| `uv run --project host pytest -q` | 47 passed, 10 hardware tests skipped |
| `npm test` in `gateway` | 22 passed, 0 failed |

| `ffmpeg -v error -i docs/assets/fieldproof-signed-receipt.webm -f null -` | Full decode passed |
| `ffprobe` on current signed-receipt video | 149.76 seconds |

The current video SHA256 is `616055dba5d09aac805bd114f79d5808918975f9031a8ad990b0b31ec85da6e3`.
A paid-result video frame and current browser screenshots were visually inspected.
The rehearsal uses simulated payment and simulated hardware. It moves no funds.
That earlier rehearsal used no hardware, mainnet, new public payment, deployment, or external judge session.
The later physical and public read-only checks appear above.
The fresh checkout came from the committed source, not private local configuration.
Browser tooling uses an existing Playwright installation. It is not an MVP runtime dependency.

The [research decision](research/2026-10-02-fieldproof.md) supersedes the inherited novelty and winner-causality claims.
The [bounty execution plan](BOUNTY_PLAN.md) records owner actions and the research stop rule.

## Historical October 1 automated checks

| Command | Observed result |
|---|---|
| `uv run --project host pytest -q --hardware` after access returned | 40 passed in 116.52 seconds |
| `npm test` in `gateway`, final source | 20 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped in 617.81 milliseconds |

| `uv run --project host pytest -q tests/test_http_interface.py tests/test_network_http.py`, earlier transport correction | 8 passed |
| `npm ci` in `gateway`, final lockfile | Installation passed. Audit reported 0 vulnerabilities at that check. |

| `idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash` | Flash completed. esptool verified the written hash. |
| `git diff --check` | Passed |
| `node --check scripts/record_demo.cjs` | Passed |
| `python3 -m py_compile scripts/build_walkthrough.py` | Passed |

No firmware or Python behavior changed after the restored-access full hardware run.
The repository declares no formatter or static type checker for these sources.
The default Python command explicitly skips hardware cases. `--hardware` requires an available board.

Python checks cover authentication, challenge binding, tampering, freshness, unstable measurements, budgets, demand, HTTP, and live BLE behavior.
Node checks cover payment policy, settlement ordering, concurrent retries, proof reuse, persistence, failure recovery, signing, and buyer freshness.
Payment unit tests use the real x402 resource-server SDK with a simulated facilitator.
A signing test cryptographically verifies a real Ed25519 buyer signature against a local RPC fixture.
The independent live purchase below establishes the chain integration separately.

## Public Devnet purchase

The user funded the disposable buyer through Circle's supported faucet interface.
Before purchase, Devnet RPC reported 20 USDC for the configured mint.
The constrained buyer then completed `node buyer.js ../.local/disposable-buyer.keypair.json` from `gateway`.
The private key remains ignored by Git. No mainnet funds were used.

- Purchase: `5776367cd42b408e`.
- Network: `solana:EtWTRABZaYq6iMfeYKouRu166VU2xqa1`.
- Transaction: `5T9cAims9tmCcgYV6KkuTedn9DhPjKmAVwENqoLjyA4GfboLfcwtTAu93Vk7kCNDyfR6QUVEpFq3XpdY7bDHoe8A`.
- Confirmed slot: `506294679`. Transaction error: `null`.
- Mint: `4zMMC9srt5Ri5X14GAgXhaHii3GnPAEERYPJgZJDncDU`.
- Merchant: `CaQAKBcwf7G5vXeu2RNuNGJafnJ8724Uj4wv9ivfxfQA`.
- Buyer token balance change: `-1000` base units. Merchant token balance change: `+1000` base units.
- Amount: 0.001 Devnet USDC, with six decimals.
- Real receipt: `gpio9-contact`, OPEN, five matching samples, independently derived DISPATCH, evidence age six seconds at verification.

[Transaction and receipt evidence](evidence/devnet-purchase.json) contains the public test result and calculated balance changes.
Independent RPC `getTransaction` returned `transferChecked` with the same mint, amount, buyer, and merchant token account.
The chain block time was `1790862927`. The device reported measurement time `1790862937`.
Device time remains host-anchored. These timestamps are not independent physical-time attestation.

Reproduce the chain lookup against `https://api.devnet.solana.com` with this JSON-RPC body:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "getTransaction",
  "params": [
    "5T9cAims9tmCcgYV6KkuTedn9DhPjKmAVwENqoLjyA4GfboLfcwtTAu93Vk7kCNDyfR6QUVEpFq3XpdY7bDHoe8A",
    {"encoding": "jsonParsed", "commitment": "confirmed", "maxSupportedTransactionVersion": 0}
  ]
}
```

For each matching token account, subtract its pre-transaction integer amount from its post-transaction integer amount.
Check the mint and owner. Check `meta.err` before interpreting the result as a successful transfer.

## Physical and runtime checks

| Check | Observed result |
|---|---|
| User held BOOT, direct authenticated BLE observation | CLOSED, WAIT, five matching samples |
| User released BOOT, separate authenticated BLE observation | OPEN, DISPATCH, five matching samples |
| Browser, simulated settlement and real contact | OPEN, DISPATCH, `physical-contact-demo` |
| Browser evidence expiry | WAIT after the ten-second freshness window |
| Browser, simulated closed contact | CLOSED, WAIT |
| Public gateway unpaid purchase | HTTP 402 with pinned Devnet USDC, merchant, and amount |
| All three video byte-range requests | HTTP 206, `video/webm`, correct byte ranges |
| Both evidence JSON routes | HTTP 200 with the expected public test results |
| Earlier browser at 390 × 844 | No horizontal overflow. Controls and evidence remained visible. |
| Earlier real Wi-Fi observation | DISPATCH, five matching samples, rejected request replay |

[Physical state evidence](evidence/contact-states.json) preserves both authenticated receipts and challenges.
The human checks used direct BLE observations and moved no funds.
No reset or GPIO output drive occurred during the input checks.

The first extended recording failed after Bluetooth became soft-blocked and powered off.
A direct bridge call identified `BleakBluetoothNotAvailableError`, rather than substituting simulated evidence.
Unblocking Bluetooth restored the adapter. A direct real observation and the next recording passed.
The failed purchase remains `delivery_failed` in its simulation ledger. No automatic retry overwrote it.

The earlier Wi-Fi failure came from an overlapping VPN route to `192.168.4.1`.
Explicit Linux interface binding restored the manifest and observation without changing global VPN routes.
The original Wi-Fi connection was restored and temporary profiles were removed.

## Reproduced defects and corrections

| Defect | Reproduction | Correction and evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Signature bytes changed payment identity | A valid buyer signature remained unchanged while the facilitator signature changed. A second local purchase incorrectly returned 200. | Hash the signed message. The regression now returns 409 for the second purchase and the original cached receipt for a retry. |
| Gateway extended buyer freshness | A gateway response supplied 3,600 seconds and the buyer entered payment. | Request and require ten seconds locally. The regression rejects the changed contract before another fetch. |
| Concurrent SQLite startup failed | A separate process opened a ledger under an exclusive lock and immediately failed with `database is locked`. | Set the busy timeout before WAL initialization. The regression waits for release and passes. |
| Buyer lost the purchase ID after a network failure | The focused test returned `Connection lost` without review context. | Connection loss and truncated delivery retain the purchase ID. Both regressions pass. |
| Physical sensor inherited the simulated-payment label | The physical simulator described its sensor as simulated. | Sensor metadata now remains separate from payment mode. The metadata regression passes. |

The signature-variant regression uses a simulated facilitator and a cryptographically valid buyer signature.
It does not claim an exploit against the public facilitator. Its own SDK also identifies settlements by transaction message.
The local ledger now enforces its own durable identity across facilitator-signature variants.
No completed real purchase existed before this identity correction. Existing tagged simulation proofs retain their original hashes.

## Historical video artifacts

| Artifact | Content | Duration | Bytes | SHA256 |

All recordings contain no audio and remain local.
The extended recording completed every scene before saving. `ffmpeg -v error -i docs/assets/fieldproof-submission.webm -f null -` passed.
Public-quote and real-contact frames were extracted and visually inspected.
The composed presentation passed full decode and visual inspection. Its 1,744 source packets remain unchanged.

Both older longer videos predate the successful public payment and human input checks.
Their pending-payment captions describe the earlier state. Use the current signed-receipt video from the latest October 4 record above.
The recording script's new quote caption states that its scene executes no payment.

## Versions and limits

ESP-IDF 6.1.0, esptool 5.4.0, Node.js 24.10.0, CPython 3.13.13, Solana Kit 5.5.1, and x402 2.27.0.
The chip is ESP32-C6FH4 revision v0.2, with 4 MB embedded flash and USB Serial/JTAG.
The earlier application SHA256 was `c56ca246115d4cab742916bfff09aa90afa0bfbbcebe7570fe7359ff06e4211a`.
The current signed-receipt firmware reports `8012b267e1c10878a46700989bf9a49a1a1c988bcc4ce1b7ec2808f1491423fb` in the [identity record](evidence/receipt-identity-checks.json).
Node's built-in SQLite emits an experimental-feature warning.

Historical receipts use the public demo HMAC key. Current physical receipts use the provisioned P-256 identity with unencrypted device storage.
Host-anchored time, reboot-cleared replay state, and the single observer remain prototype limits.
No external gate sensor, protected identity, calibrated confidence, vehicle controller, customer pilot, peaq activation, or public deployment exists.
